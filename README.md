# FantasyBballOptimizer
Using ESPN Fantasy Basketball, the idea is to maximize the number of players playing in one fantasy week given a number of matchup acquisitions available.
1. create season schedule using API and filter into a csv file
2. running notebook:
    - first obtain scrapes data of current team and available free agents
    - choose players that are available to swap
    - create decision tree of swapping or keeping player
    - find all possible combinations that maximizes the number of plays in an entire week
    - showcase procedure
